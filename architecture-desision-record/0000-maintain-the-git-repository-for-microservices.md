# Maintain the Git Repository for Microservices

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Binoy
* Date: 2024-10-27

## Context and Problem Statement

The microservices architecture in our application involves multiple independently deployable services, each with its unique lifecycle. A consistent and effective approach to managing the Git repositories for these services is required to streamline development, CI/CD processes, and maintain codebase organization. Without a defined strategy, managing repository structures could lead to inconsistencies, inefficiencies in code management, and difficulties in scaling development and deployment pipelines.

## Decision Drivers

* Codebase Structure: How code for each microservice should be organized in repositories.
* Version Control: Ensuring each microservice can be versioned and tagged independently.
* Collaboration: Facilitating contributions and issue tracking for each microservice.
* CI/CD Pipelines: Enabling efficient deployment processes that can handle microservices independently.

## Considered Options

* Individual Git repositories
* Mono-repository

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Individual Git repositories", because We will maintain individual Git repositories for each microservice, as opposed to a single monolithic or mono-repository structure.

**Rationale**
- Independent Development: Individual repositories allow each microservice to evolve independently, promoting autonomous deployments and enabling service-specific versioning and tags.
- Scalability: With individual repositories, scaling development teams and handling changes in CI/CD pipelines become manageable, reducing dependencies and potential conflicts.
- Security and Access Control: Repositories can be restricted based on microservices ownership or team, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access across unrelated services.
- Clear Audit Trails: Independent repositories make it easier to trace the history of each microservice and maintain clear change logs.

**Mono-repository (Monorepo): A single repository for all microservices.**

Pros: Easier management of shared code; simpler dependency tracking and orchestration.
Cons: Less flexibility; increased repository size, making CI/CD slower; lack of independence for service-specific deployments.

**Hybrid Approach: Use a mono-repository for closely related microservices while others have individual repositories.**

Pros: Optimized for microservices with high interdependencies while keeping others independent.
Cons: Adds complexity in deciding where each service fits; still has drawbacks of the monorepo approach.

**Implementation Plan**
* Repository Creation: Create individual repositories for each microservice in our organizationâ€™s Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
* Naming Conventions: Establish clear naming conventions for each service repository.
* CI/CD Pipeline Configuration: Set up CI/CD pipelines for each repository, ensuring each microservice can be tested and deployed independently.
* Documentation Standards: Define guidelines for documentation and README files to ensure consistency across repositories.
* Access Control and Permissions: Implement role-based access controls tailored to each repository to secure sensitive microservices.

**Decision Review**
Review Date: 6 months post-implementation

**Evaluation Metrics:**
* Developer feedback on repository organization and ease of use.
* CI/CD pipeline performance and efficiency.
* Incidents or errors due to cross-service changes.

**Additional Notes**
This decision may be revisited if new requirements for code sharing or microservice interdependencies emerge.

### Positive Consequences

* Encourages modular development, enabling service teams to iterate on services independently.
* Supports dedicated CI/CD pipelines per microservice, which can be triggered, tested, and deployed individually.
* Facilitates clear documentation and version control of each microservice.

### Negative Consequences

* Increased management overhead with a higher number of repositories to maintain.
* Cross-cutting changes that impact multiple services might require additional coordination.
