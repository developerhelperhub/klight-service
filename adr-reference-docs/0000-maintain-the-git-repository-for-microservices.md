# ADR: Maintain the Git Repository for Microservices
Referene ChatGPT

## Alternatives Considered

### Mono-repository (Monorepo): A single repository for all microservices.

Pros: Easier management of shared code; simpler dependency tracking and orchestration.
Cons: Less flexibility; increased repository size, making CI/CD slower; lack of independence for service-specific deployments.

### Hybrid Approach: Use a mono-repository for closely related microservices while others have individual repositories.

Pros: Optimized for microservices with high interdependencies while keeping others independent.
Cons: Adds complexity in deciding where each service fits; still has drawbacks of the monorepo approach.

## Implementation Plan
* Repository Creation: Create individual repositories for each microservice in our organizationâ€™s Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
* Naming Conventions: Establish clear naming conventions for each service repository.
* CI/CD Pipeline Configuration: Set up CI/CD pipelines for each repository, ensuring each microservice can be tested and deployed independently.
* Documentation Standards: Define guidelines for documentation and README files to ensure consistency across repositories.
* Access Control and Permissions: Implement role-based access controls tailored to each repository to secure sensitive microservices.

## Decision Review
Review Date: 6 months post-implementation

Evaluation Metrics:
* Developer feedback on repository organization and ease of use.
* CI/CD pipeline performance and efficiency.
* Incidents or errors due to cross-service changes.

## Additional Notes
This decision may be revisited if new requirements for code sharing or microservice interdependencies emerge.
